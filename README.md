# Terraform Deployment Project

## About

This repository demonstrates the deployment of infrastructure using Terraform. The project automates the provisioning of cloud resources, ensuring efficient and scalable infrastructure management. This project is built to illustrate proficiency in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, cloud infrastructure management, and Terraform scripting.

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of how Terraform can be used to automate cloud infrastructure deployment. The repository contains Terraform scripts and configuration files to create and manage cloud resources in a repeatable and consistent manner. 

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage infrastructure through code for consistency and repeatability.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale infrastructure resources up or down as needed.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized into reusable modules for better management.
- **Cloud Agnostic**: Easily adaptable for various cloud providers.

## Architecture

This project leverages Terraform to define and manage the following infrastructure components:

- **Compute Resources**: Virtual machines, load balancers, etc.
- **Networking**: VPCs, subnets, security groups, etc.
- **Storage**: S3 buckets, RDS databases, etc.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Terraform**: Ensure that Terraform is installed on your system.
- **Cloud Provider Account**: You will need an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patelrinkesh24/Terraform-Deployment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Terraform-Deployment
   ```

### Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
2. Review the plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
3. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
