# Terraform Deployment

## About

This project demonstrates the deployment of a scalable, secure, and highly available infrastructure using Terraform. The architecture is designed to provision resources on AWS, enabling the automation of infrastructure setup, configuration, and management.

## Project Architecture

The architecture includes the following components:
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud to logically isolate the deployed resources.
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- **Internet Gateway**: To allow public traffic into the VPC.
- **NAT Gateway**: To allow private subnets to access the internet securely.
- **Route Tables**: Custom route tables for controlling traffic routing within the VPC.
- **EC2 Instances**: Elastic Compute Cloud instances deployed in the private subnets.
- **RDS**: Relational Database Service for database management.
- **S3 Buckets**: For storing static files and logs.
- **Security Groups**: For managing inbound and outbound traffic to resources.
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: For controlling access to AWS services and resources.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v1.x
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Basic understanding of AWS services and Terraform

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patelrinkesh24/Terraform-Deployment.git
   cd Terraform-Deployment
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   Initialize Terraform to download the necessary plugins and providers:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Customize Variables**
   Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to match your environment and preferences:
   ```hcl
   aws_region = "us-west-2"
   vpc_cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
   ...
   ```

4. **Validate the Configuration**
   Ensure that the configuration is correct:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

5. **Apply the Configuration**
   Deploy the infrastructure by running:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Confirm the changes by typing `yes` when prompted.

6. **Access Your Resources**
   After the deployment is complete, you can access your resources via the AWS Management Console.

## Usage

This project is designed to be easily reusable and adaptable. You can modify the Terraform configuration files to add or remove resources based on your needs. The output variables will provide you with essential information such as instance IDs, public IP addresses, and database connection strings.

## Cleanup

To destroy all the resources created by this Terraform project, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
Confirm the destruction by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Conclusion

This project showcases a robust and scalable infrastructure deployment using Terraform. By following the setup instructions, you can easily replicate this architecture in your own AWS environment. The project is structured to be extensible, allowing for further customization and enhancement.
